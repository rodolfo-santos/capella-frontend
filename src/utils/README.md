# Utils Directory

## Overview

The `utils` directory contains utility functions, helpers, and shared logic that doesn't fit within specific architectural layers but is used across the application. These utilities enhance code reusability and maintainability.

## Responsibilities

1. **Helper Functions**: Reusable functions that perform common tasks, like data formatting or validation.
2. **Shared Logic**: Any logic or method that is used in multiple places across the application but doesn't belong to a specific component or module.
3. **Constants**: Shared constants that are used across the application.

## Directory Structure

- **/formatters**: Contains utility functions related to formatting data.
- **/validators**: Houses utility functions for data validation.
- `constants.js`: A file for defining shared constants.

## Usage

For instance, a utility function to format dates might look like:

```javascript
export function formatDate(date) {
  // Logic to format a date into a desired string format
  return formattedDate
}
```
