# Router Directory

## Overview

The `router` directory is responsible for managing and defining the application's routing logic. It determines how the application responds to client requests to particular endpoints or paths.

## Responsibilities

1. **Route Definitions**: Specify which component or page should be rendered for a given path.
2. **Navigation Guards**: Implement logic that can restrict access to certain routes based on conditions (e.g., user authentication).
3. **Route Metadata**: Attach additional information to routes, like titles or required permissions.

## Directory Structure

- **/middlewares**: Contains middleware functions or navigation guards that can be applied to routes.
- `index.js` or `routes.js`: Main file where routes are defined and exported.

## Usage

A basic route definition might look like:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueRouter from 'vue-router'
import Dashboard from '@/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.vue'
import Login from '@/pages/login/Login.vue'

Vue.use(VueRouter)

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    name: 'Dashboard',
    component: Dashboard
  },
  {
    path: '/login',
    name: 'Login',
    component: Login
  }
]

const router = new VueRouter({
  mode: 'history',
  base: process.env.BASE_URL,
  routes
})

export default router
```

## Tips

1. **Nested Routes:** Vue Router supports nested routes, which can be useful for complex UI structures.
2. **Lazy Loading:** Use Vue's async component feature to achieve lazy-loaded routes, optimizing performance.
3. **Middleware:** Utilize navigation guards for logic like checking authentication before granting access to a route.
