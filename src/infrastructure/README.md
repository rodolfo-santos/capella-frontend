# Infrastructure Directory

## Overview

The `infrastructure` directory encompasses all the technical concerns and external interfaces of the application, such as database interactions, API requests, or third-party service integrations. It serves as a bridge between your domain and the outer layers of your application.

## Responsibilities

1. **Data Persistence**: Handle all database operations, be it SQL, NoSQL, or any other type of data storage.
2. **External Services**: Connect with third-party services or APIs.
3. **Messaging and Eventing**: Handle event publishing and messaging mechanisms, if any.
4. **Utility Services**: Provide services like caching, logging, or configuration.
5. **Mapping**: Convert between domain entities and database models if an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is used.

## Directory Structure

- **/database**: Contains all database-related operations, migrations, seeds, and ORM models.
- **/api**: Houses logic related to external API integrations or requests.
- **/services**: Contains utility services and other infrastructure-related services.
- **/mappers**: For objects that convert or map domain entities to infrastructure-specific objects and vice versa.
- **/config**: Contains configuration files related to infrastructure concerns.

## Usage

For instance, using a database repository to fetch a user might look like:

```javascript
import UserRepository from '@/infrastructure/database/UserRepository'

const userRepo = new UserRepository()
const user = userRepo.findById(1)
```

## Tips

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Always keep infrastructure logic separate from the domain logic. Avoid any business logic here.
2. **Adapters & Ports**: Consider the Adapter pattern to decouple the application from specific technologies or third-party libraries.
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Rely on abstractions, not on concrete implementations. This ensures that the domain layer remains decoupled from the infrastructure layer, facilitating changes to the infrastructure without affecting the domain.
