# Domain Directory

## Overview

The `domain` directory is central to the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. It houses the core business logic and business rules of the application, independent of any external influences like databases or frameworks.

## Responsibilities

1. **Entities**: Represent the main objects or concepts of the system and hold core business logic.
2. **Value Objects**: Objects that represent descriptive aspects of the domain with no conceptual identity.
3. **Aggregates**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit.
4. **Domain Events**: Represent something significant that happened within the domain.
5. **Enums**: Enumerations related to the domain logic.
6. **Exceptions**: Custom error types relevant to the domain logic.

## Directory Structure

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **/aggregates**: Groups related entities and value objects into a cohesive unit.
- **/entities**: Contains the primary entities of the domain.
- **/enums**: Contains any domain-specific enumerations.
- **/events**: Contains domain events.
- **/exceptions**: For domain-specific exception classes.
- **/value-objects**: Houses value objects which are immutable and don't have a unique identity.

## Example

Imagine a `User` entity in an e-commerce domain:

- The `User` might have methods like `changePassword`, `placeOrder`, or `updateProfile`.
- Related value objects could include `Address`, `Email`, or `Password`.
- The `User` entity might be part of an `Account` aggregate which groups `User` with `Profile` and `OrderHistory`.
- An event like `UserRegistered` could be triggered when a new user signs up.

## Tips

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: Use a common, domain-specific language that is understood by both developers and domain experts.
2. **Rich vs. Anemic Models**: Strive for rich domain models that encapsulate logic, rather than anemic models that are only data structures.
3. **Immutable Value Objects**: Ensure that value objects are immutable to preserve data integrity.
