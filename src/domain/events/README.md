# Domain Events

## Overview

Domain Events capture the result of an action or a change in the domain. They represent something of interest that has happened within the domain and can be used to decouple various aspects of the domain, notify external systems, or keep track of changes.

## Principles

1. **Immutability**: Once a domain event is created, it should not be modified. This ensures that historical events remain consistent.
2. **Decoupling**: Domain events can be used to decouple different parts of the system, allowing for more modular and maintainable code.
3. **Historical Record**: Events can act as a log or a record of actions taken in the system, providing a traceable history.

## Structure

Inside this folder, you'll find different events that get triggered within our domain. Each event file typically describes an action or a change that has occurred, like `TaskCreated`, `UserAssigned`, or `TaskCompleted`.

## Usage

Domain events can be dispatched when a certain action occurs within an entity or aggregate. Listeners or subscribers can then react to these events, enabling side-effects like sending notifications, updating projections, or triggering other domain actions.

## Examples

- `TaskCreated`: An event that is dispatched when a new task is created. It might contain details like the task's ID, title, and initial status.
- `UserAssigned`: Might be triggered when a user is assigned to a task, capturing the user's ID and the task's ID.

## Note

It's crucial to design domain events carefully, ensuring they represent meaningful actions in the domain. Over time, as the domain evolves, new events may emerge, or existing ones might become obsolete. Regularly reviewing and refining your domain events helps in keeping them aligned with the domain's reality.
