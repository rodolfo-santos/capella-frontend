# Capella Frontend

A frontend project showcasing the implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles using Vue.js.

## Why "Capella"?

The name "Capella" is inspired by one of the brightest stars in the night sky. Just as stars provide guidance in the darkness, this project aims to guide developers through the complexities of modern frontend architecture.

## Overview

This project is designed to serve as a practical example for those interested in adopting DDD and Clean Architecture in frontend applications. By structuring the application this way, we aim for modularity, scalability, and maintainability, making it easier to understand, adapt, and expand upon.

## Features

- User registration and authentication.
- A dashboard providing an overview of user activities.
- Category listings for items.
- Modular components for easy UI management.
