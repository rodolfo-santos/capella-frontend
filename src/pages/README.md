# Pages Directory

## Overview

The `pages` directory contains the top-level views or screens of the application. These pages often represent different routes or URLs in the application, combining multiple components to present a complete view to the user.

## Responsibilities

1. **Routing**: Represents the main entry points defined by the application's routing system.
2. **Page Composition**: Composes components together to form complete views or screens.
3. **Data Fetching**: Often responsible for fetching the necessary data needed for a page before rendering.

## Directory Structure

- **/category**: Contains files related to product or item categories, showcasing listings and category-specific data.
- **/dashboard**: Dedicated to the user's main interface after logging in, where primary interactions and overviews are presented.
- **/login**: Holds the files responsible for user authentication, including input forms and validation.
- **/register**: Contains the user registration interface, encompassing user input, validation, and potential onboarding flows.

## Usage

A typical page might combine various components and data fetching logic to provide a full view:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Header />
    <ProductList :products="products" />
    <Footer />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Header from '@/components/layout/Header.vue'
import ProductList from '@/components/common/ProductList.vue'
import Footer from '@/components/layout/Footer.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    Header,
    ProductList,
    Footer
  },
  data() {
    return {
      products: []
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // Data fetching logic, e.g., API call to get products
  }
}
</script>
```

## Tips

1. **Lazy Loading**: Consider using lazy loading for pages to improve initial load times, especially for larger applications.
2. **Data Pre-fetching**: Use Vue's navigation guards or a similar mechanism to fetch data before a page is rendered.
3. **Clear Naming**: Name your pages clearly to indicate their purpose, e.g., UserProfile.vue rather than just Profile.vue.
