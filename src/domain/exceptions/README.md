# Domain Exceptions

## Overview

Domain Exceptions represent unexpected conditions or violations of business rules within the domain. They encapsulate errors that might arise when enforcing invariants or when executing domain logic.

## Principles

1. **Specificity**: Each exception should be specific to a particular error or violation, making it easy to identify the root cause.
2. **Clarity**: Exception names and messages should be descriptive, providing clear context about the error.
3. **Handling**: Not all domain exceptions are catastrophic. They can be handled gracefully to ensure the system remains robust and user-friendly.

## Structure

This directory contains various exception classes specific to our domain. For example, in a task management system, you might encounter exceptions like `TaskNotFoundException`, `UserNotAuthorizedException`, or `InvalidTaskStatusException`.

## Usage

Domain exceptions are thrown when domain logic encounters an unexpected condition or when an operation cannot proceed due to a business rule violation. They can be caught and handled at higher layers (like the application or UI layer) to provide meaningful feedback to the user or to trigger compensating actions.

## Examples

- `TaskNotFoundException`: Thrown when an attempt is made to access a task that doesn't exist in the repository.
- `UserNotAuthorizedException`: Triggered when a user tries to perform an action they don't have permissions for.

## Note

When defining exceptions, it's essential to ensure they are meaningful and align with the domain's realities. Overly generic exceptions can make error handling and debugging more challenging. Remember, the goal is to provide clarity and context when things go wrong.
